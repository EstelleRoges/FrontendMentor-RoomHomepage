## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this e-commerce homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

### What I learned
Honestly, I learned how to breathe when I spend several hours trying to solve a problem but don't succeed...they didn't put the chllenge in the "Intermediate" section for nothing! Or I really have to make some serious progress...
The slider is what took me an awful amount of time. But even if I know it's not perfect, it works pretty well and that's great!
